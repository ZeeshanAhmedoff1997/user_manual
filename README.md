## Security Enhancements

### 1. Authentication

- Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can upload and process manuals.

### 2. Rate Limiting

- Introduce rate limiting to prevent abuse and overload of the system, ensuring stable and reliable service.

## Functionality Improvements

### 1. Extended Processing

- Allow for the extraction of additional sections beyond troubleshooting, such as FAQs, setup instructions, and maintenance guidelines.

### 2. Customizable JSON Schema

- Enable users to define the schema of the JSON output. This feature would facilitate easier integration with various frontend systems, allowing users to specify the structure and types of data they require.

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Webhook Implementation

- Utilize webhooks to notify users or systems when the processing of the manual is complete, improving the workflow and reducing the need for repeated status checks.

### 2. Efficient Manual Processing

- **User-Specified Page Ranges**: Allow users to specify the range of pages to be processed, minimizing the processing load and focusing on relevant content.
- **Index-Based Page Identification**: Implement functionality to automatically identify pages relevant to troubleshooting (or other topics) based on the manual's index, streamlining the extraction process.
- **OCR Topic Detection**: Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and process only the pages related to specified topics, enhancing system efficiency by avoiding unnecessary processing.

## Conclusion

These improvements and features aim to make the demo project more secure, functional, and efficient, addressing potential user needs and system performance issues.
